# Movies

Create your own movies library, hosted on your own server, where you can note the movies you have already seen. You can
also use this app to find your next movie and download it.

To start your new Phoenix application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
